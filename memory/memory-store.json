Quality distribution: 4 high-confidence (≥0.7), 56 medium-confidence (0.4-0.7), 61 low-confidence (<0.4). Key enhancements: Advanced German NLP, multi-dimensional scoring, technical term recognition, category-specific weighting. Output: content-image-seo-mapping-enhanced.json. 8 files unmapped (safety coordination niche). Recommendation: Implement neural training for continuous improvement.",
