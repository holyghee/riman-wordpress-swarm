├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│  Variant 3  │  Variant 4  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### 3. Variant Analysis
Each variant undergoes comprehensive evaluation:
- **/describe analysis** - AI-generated description and keywords
- **RIMAN relevance scoring** - 4-factor assessment system
- **Professional quality rating** - Technical and compositional analysis
- **B2B appeal measurement** - Business audience effectiveness

### 4. Selection Criteria
**RIMAN Scoring System (0-10 scale):**

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Professional Quality** | 25% | Photography quality, composition, lighting |
| **B2B Appeal** | 25% | Executive presence, authority, trustworthiness |
| **Technical Accuracy** | 25% | Industry-specific elements, authenticity |
