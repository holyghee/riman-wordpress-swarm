# üîç Midjourney Variant Analysis Methodology
**RIMAN Altlasten Image Optimization Framework**  
**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Focus:** Systematic 2x2 Grid Analysis for German Environmental Services

---

## üìã Analysis Framework Overview

### Systematic Evaluation Process
For each Altlasten subservice, we generate a 2x2 grid (4 variants) and systematically evaluate each variant using both automated `/describe` analysis and manual RIMAN relevance scoring. This ensures optimal selection based on technical accuracy, professional appeal, and German market positioning.

### Core Evaluation Dimensions
1. **Technical Accuracy** (25% weight)
2. **Professional Appeal** (25% weight)  
3. **Equipment Visibility** (20% weight)
4. **Regulatory Compliance** (15% weight)
5. **Market Positioning** (15% weight)

## üìä Scoring Methodology Details

### Rating Scale (1-10 points each criterion)
- **1-3:** Poor/Inadequate - Does not meet RIMAN standards
- **4-6:** Acceptable - Meets basic requirements
- **7-8:** Good - Exceeds expectations with clear value
- **9-10:** Excellent - Outstanding representation of RIMAN expertise

### Weighted Composite Score Calculation
```
Final Score = (Criterion1 √ó Weight1) + (Criterion2 √ó Weight2) + ... + (Criterion5 √ó Weight5)

Example for Erkundung:
Final Score = (Technical √ó 0.25) + (Professional √ó 0.25) + (Equipment √ó 0.20) + (Regulatory √ó 0.15) + (Market √ó 0.15)
```

### Selection Thresholds
- **Immediate Selection:** Score ‚â• 8.5 (Excellent)
- **Enhancement Required:** Score 7.0-8.4 (Generate variations/upscaling)
- **Regeneration Needed:** Score < 7.0 (New prompt iteration)

## üîÑ Analysis Workflow Implementation

### Step 1: Automated Analysis
```javascript
// For each variant (V1-V4):
midjourney_describe({
  imageUrl: "variant_image_url"
})

// Document results in analysis matrix
// Extract technical keywords and professional elements
// Identify equipment and compliance indicators
```

### Step 2: Manual RIMAN Relevance Scoring
```javascript
// For each criterion:
1. Review /describe output for relevant keywords
2. Visual assessment against RIMAN standards
3. German market positioning evaluation
4. B2B professional appeal assessment
5. Technical accuracy verification

// Document scores in variant matrix
```

### Step 3: Comparative Analysis
```javascript
// Compare all 4 variants:
1. Rank by composite score
2. Identify top performer
3. Analyze improvement opportunities
4. Document selection rationale

// Generate enhancement strategy if needed
```

### Step 4: Optimization Decision
```javascript
if (topScore >= 8.5) {
  selectVariant();
  upscaleImage();
} else if (topScore >= 7.0) {
  generateVariations();
  reanalyze();
} else {
  regenerateWithImprovedPrompt();
}
```
